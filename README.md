## Description
This project aims to how mapping a land into map automatically using Genetic Algorithm.
In this case, I take Hutatoruan IX Village (located in Tarutung, North Sumatera) as an example.
Where as many as 242 land objects must be plotted automatically.
This project still in development, because the goal has not been achieved.
So far, there is only 50 land objetcs can be plotted at the same time.
